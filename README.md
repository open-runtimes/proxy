Proxy server for [Open Runtimes](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes), a runtime environments for serverless cloud computing for multiple coding languages.

The proxy is responsible for checking health of executors, and proxying requests between them based on selected strategy, such as round-robin. Proxy is stateless and can be scaled horizontally when a load balanced is introduced in front of it.

## Features

* **Flexibility** - Adapter-driven approach allows switching between proxying strategies. You can even implement your own.
* **Performance** - Coroutine-style HTTP servers allows asynchronous operations without blocking. We. Run. Fast! ‚ö°
* **Open Source** - Released under the MIT license, free to use and extend.

## Getting Started

1. Pull Open Runtimes Proxy image:

```bash
docker pull openruntimes/proxy
```

2. Pull whoami image:

```bash
docker pull containous/whoami
```

3. Create `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  openruntimes-proxy:
    image: openruntimes/proxy
    ports:
      - 9800:80
    environment:
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ALGORITHM
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTORS
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ENV
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTOR_SECRET
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_PROVIDER
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_CONFIG
      - OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK
  whoami1:
    hostname: whoami1
    image: containous/whoami
  whoami2:
    hostname: whoami2
    image: containous/whoami
```

> We are adding 1 proxy and 2 HTTP servers. Notice only proxy is exported, on a port `9800`.

4. Create `.env` file:

```
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ALGORITHM=round-robin
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTORS=whoami1,whoami2
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK=disabled
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET=proxy-secret-key
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL=5000
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ENV=development
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTOR_SECRET=executor-secret-key
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_PROVIDER=
OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_CONFIG=
```

> Notice we disabled health check. We recommend keeping it `enabled` and implementing proper health check endpoint

5. Start Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

6. Send a HTTP request to proxy server:

```bash
curl -H "authorization: Bearer proxy-secret-key" -X GET http://localhost:9800/
```

Run the command multiple times to see request being proxied between both whoami servers. You can see `Hostname` changing the value.

> Noitce we provided authorization header as configured in `.env` in `OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET`.

7. Stop Docker containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ALGORITHM            | Proxying algorithm. Supports `round-robin`, `random`.                                                                                     |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTORS            | Comma-separated hostnames of servers under the proxy.                                                                                     |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK          | Health check by HTTP request to /v1/health. 'enabled' by default. To disable, set to 'disabled'.                                          |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL | Delay in milliseconds between health checks. 10000 by default. Only relevant if OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_HEALTHCHECK is 'enabled'.             |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_ENV                  | Runtime environment. 'production' or 'development'. Development may expose debug information and is not recommended on production server. |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_SECRET               | Secret that needs to be provided in `Authroization` header when communicating with the to proxy.                                          |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_EXECUTOR_SECRET      | String provided as `authorization` header by proxy when sending request to executor.                                                      |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_PROVIDER     | Logging provider. Supports `sentry`, `appsignal`, `raygun`, `logowl`. Leave empty for no cloud logging.                                   |
| OPEN_RUNTIMES_PROXY_LOGGING_CONFIG       | Logging configuration as requested by `utopia-php/logger`.                                                                                |
